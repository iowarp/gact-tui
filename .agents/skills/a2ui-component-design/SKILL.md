# Designing A2UI components (CLIO catalogs)

Distilled from issue #1533 (data by reference for every component, surfaces from files,
one-call progressive disclosure) — the friction a live probe found: a model that reaches for
A2UI correctly but then fights the catalog to get real data onto the screen. Every rule below
exists to remove one such fight, not to add ceremony.

## 1. Inline values OR a dataset reference — both, never inline-only

Like `plot([1, 2, 3])` versus `plot(dataset.x)`: every component that carries rows, points, a
diagram, source, or a diff must accept its content two ways — a small inline property (`data`,
`rows`, `points`, `source`, `code`, `diff`) **or** `dataUri` (a reference to a registered
artifact) — never both at once, never neither. A component that only takes inline values forces
an agent to copy a dataset into a tool call by hand, which is what produced the original bug (a
map split into 7 panels because the model manually chunked points past a hand-typed limit).

- A cap on the inline path (e.g. the map's 500 points, the chart's 10k rows) limits what can be
  **drawn** inline; it never limits what can be **referenced** through `dataUri`. A referenced
  dataset is bounded by `dataQuery`/`limit` and the viewer instead.
- The three tabular components (`clio.chart.v1`, `clio.map.v1`, `clio.data-table.v1`) additionally
  accept `dataQuery` — one shared shape (filter, aggregate, downsample, limit), `$ref`'d from a
  single `$defs/DataQuery`, never redefined per component. `dataQuery` is only ever valid alongside
  `dataUri`.
- A component that reads a dataset names its columns with `*Field` properties (`xField`,
  `latitudeField`, `entityField`, `labelField`, ...) instead of assuming a fixed row shape. Field
  names required by `dataUri` (e.g. the map's `latitudeField`/`longitudeField`/`labelField`) are
  optional when the component uses inline values instead — the cross-field rule is "required
  together with `dataUri`," not "always required."
- Encode "exactly one of X or dataUri" as a real cross-field rule in both the JSON Schema
  (`oneOf` with `required`/`not: {required: [...]}` branches) and the pydantic model
  (`model_validator(mode="after")`), so a wrong payload is a typed validation error, not a
  silently-empty view.

## 2. One charting layer

`clio.chart.v1` is the only chart component: a `preset` (a named, guarded Vega-Lite template) or
an agent-authored Vega-Lite `spec`, guarded (size, view count, no `url`/`usermeta`, `data` only as
the named source) so it can never fetch a URL or smuggle rows outside the component's own
`data`/`dataUri`. Do not add a second, narrower chart component for a new plot type — extend the
preset library or let the agent author a `spec` instead. A bespoke chart component duplicates the
data-by-reference and selection work this skill exists to keep in one place.

## 3. Linking views: shared selection

Components that show the same entities from different angles (a chart, a map, a table) bind their
`selection` property to the same `/selection/<key>` data-model path. The value there is a
`SelectionState` (`{field, values[], source?}`, one shared `$defs/SelectionState`). Clicking an
entity in one view writes the shared path; every other component bound to it follows, with no
agent turn in between — the marimo-style reactive goal. Give every linked, data-carrying component
a `selection` property when you add one; do not invent a second selection mechanism.

## 4. Document in the catalog, not beside it

An agent reads a component's contract two ways: the generated one-line catalog index (a
`description` plus its property signature) and, on a deeper look, the component's schema and
`instructions.md`. That means:

- Every component schema carries a one-sentence `description` (what it is for, not how it's
  implemented) — e.g. `clio.map.v1`: "Points on an interactive map (stations, sites,
  epicenters)." Every data-input property (`dataUri`, `*Field`, `dataQuery`, ...) carries a short
  `description` too. Keep both short and exact: the generated index is built from them verbatim.
- `instructions.md` states each cross-cutting rule once (inline-or-dataset, shared selection,
  routing actions) rather than repeating it in every component's example — repetition there is
  what a `load_skill` budget pays for on every dashboard.
- Never restate a property's shape in prose beyond what the schema already enforces; prose drifts,
  JSON Schema does not.

## 5. Catalog, validator, and renderer change together

A new property or component lands as one change across: the JSON Schema (`catalog_bounded.py` for
anything with bounds or cross-field rules, the generic factory for a plain scalar shape), the
pydantic model that mirrors it, and the renderer that draws it (gact-tui). The validator checks
`*Field` column names against the referenced dataset's real columns — a wrong column name is a
typed error at validation time, not a blank chart discovered by the scientist. Landing only the
schema half of a change ships a contract nothing enforces or draws.

## 6. Progressive disclosure: one or two lookups per surface

An agent should be able to build most surfaces from the generated index alone (one line per
component: description + signature) plus, at most, one `load_skill` call for the one component it
needs more detail on. Keep signatures in the index short enough that this stays true — this is why
descriptions and property lists stay terse (rule 4) and why `$defs` referenced by a schema resolve
inline in the returned file rather than costing a further round trip.

## 7. Surfaces keep their definition

A surface's component list may be authored as an inline array or written to a file
(`components_path`) — either way, the final component JSON that was actually sent is stored as a
registered artifact attached to the surface. A surface's definition is always recoverable after
the fact, the same way a component's data is always a real reference, never a value that only
existed inside one tool call.

## 8. Acceptance is a live run, not a schema review

A catalog/validator/renderer change is not done when it type-checks; it is done when a live agent
run of a real prompt (e.g. "chart these 500 rows and show the matching stations on a map") on both
a strong and a weak model produces the expected surface with no data loss (no manual chunking, no
silently dropped rows, no dataset the agent gave up referencing) and no more than one or two
`load_skill`/lookup round trips. Measure tool calls, lookup count, and rows lost between the
dataset and what actually rendered — not just "no validation errors."
